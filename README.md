# boot-slidev

This is a project template for quickly bootstrapping a [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) presentation.

## Usage

To create a new Slidev presentation based on this template, you can use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to clone the repo and remove the `.git` folder:

```bash
npx degit kirklin/boot-slidev my-presentation
cd my-presentation
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Slidev presentation in a directory called `my-presentation`, install the necessary dependencies, and start the development server. You can then edit the presentation in the `slides.md` file and see the changes in real-time with the development server running.

## Template Customization

This template can be customized to suit your specific needs. You can modify the `template.html` file to change the layout and styling of the presentation, or you can modify the `slides.md` file to create your own content.
